workflow generating 3D structures and DFT computed chemical shifts from 2D structures in the NMR8K. The workflow automatically embedding 3D structures, searching conformers, optimizing structures by FF and DFT, computed chemical shifts. 

The workflow depeneds on ASE DB and RDKit. 

The workflow interacts with queueing software found on the super cluster. Please modify the shell script part in the calculator.py to match your queueing software.
