The DFT8K dataset is calculated from the NMR8K dataset. The DFT calculated chemical shift are stored in the DFT8K.csv file, associated with the corresponding atom type and atom index. The mol_id column is the id for each molecule, which is the ID found in the NMRShiftDB database. DFT optimized 3D structures are stored in the DFT.sdf, while FF optimized 3D structure are stroed in the FF.sdf. The name of each structure in the .sdf file are the mol_id, which can be found in the DFT8K.csv file.
