This folder contains the structure and manually assigned experimental chemical shift for structures with molecular weight > 500 in the NMRShiftDB database. These structures are out of the scope of training set. And are used to demonstrate that the model developed in this work can be applied to high-trhoughput screening such as automatically chemical shift revisions.

Experimental chemical shifts are stored in nprod.csv.gz. Structures are stored in nprod.sdf.gz. For each molecule, we search 200 conformers, which are kept in the .sdf file.
